Display the file listing of the present directory.

### Function 2 : Load File

Load a file by name into memory. On input:

On output:

Error location contains an error/status code.

### Function 3 : Store File

### Function 4 : File Open

Opens a file into a specific channel. On input:

Parameter:0 contains the file channel to open;

Parameters:1,2 points to the length-prefixed filename string;

Parameter:3 contains the open mode. See below.

Valid open modes are:

0 opens the file for read-only access;

2 opens the file for read-write access;

3 creates the file if it doesn't already exist, truncates it if it does, and opens the file for read-write access.

Modes 0 to 2 will fail if the file does not already exist. If the channel is already open, the call fails. Opening the same file more than once on different channels has undefined behaviour, and is not recommended.

### Function 5 : File Close

Parameter:0 contains the file channel to operate on;

Parameters:1..4 contains the file location.

You can seek beyond the end of a file to extend the file. However, whether the file size changes when the seek happens, or when you perform the write is undefined behavior.

### Function 7 : File Tell

On output:

Parameters:1..4 contains the seek location within the file.

### Function 8 : File Read

Data is read from the current seek position, which is advanced after the read.

### Function 9 : File Write

Writes data to an opened file. On input:

Parameter:0 contains the file channel to operate on;

Parameters:1,2 points to the data in memory;

Parameters:3,4 contains the amount of data to write.

On output:

Parameters:3,4 is updated to contain the amount of data actually written.

Data is written to the current seek position, which is advanced after the write.

Parameter:0 contains the file channel to operate on.

On output:

Parameters:0,1 points to the length-prefixed filename string.

Parameters:0..3 contains the length of the file;

Parameter:4 contains the attributes bit-field of the file.

If the file is open for writing, this may not return the correct size due to buffered data not having been flushed to disk.

File attributes are a bitfield as follows: 0,0,0,Hidden, Read Only, Archive, System, Directory.

### Function 17 : Open Directory

Opens a directory for enumeration. On input:

Parameters:0,1 points to the length-prefixed filename string.

Only one directory at a time may be opened. If a directory is already open when this call is made, it is automatically closed. However, an open directory may make it impossible to delete the directory; so closing the directory after use is good practice.

### Function 18 : Read Directory

Reads an item from the currently open directory. On input:

Parameters:0,1 points to a length-prefixed buffer for returning the filename.

Parameters:0,1 is unchanged, but the buffer is updated to contain the

length-prefixed filename (without any leading path);

Parameters:2..5 contains the length of the file;

Parameter:6 contains the file attributes, as described by Function 3,16 "File Stat".

If there are no more items to read, this call fails and an error is flagged.

### Function 19 : Close Directory

Closes any directory opened previously by Function 3,17 "Open Directory".

### Function 20 : Copy File

Copies a file. On input:

Parameters:0,1 points to the length-prefixed old filename;

Parameters:0,1 points to the length-prefixed filename;

Parameter:2 is the attribute bitfield. (See Stat File for details.)

The directory bit cannot be changed. Obviously.

### Function 22 : Check End of File.

Returns the end of file status of an opened file. On input:

Parameter:0 contains the file channel to operate on.

On output:

Parameter:0 is non-zero if the file is at the end of the file.

This call should be used on open files and may return an error if the file is closed.

### Function 23 : Get Current Working Directory.

Copies the current working directory into the String at address Parameters:0,1. which is of maximum length Parameters:2

### Function 32 : List Filtered

Prints a filtered file listing of the current directory to the console. On input:

Parameters:0,1 points to the filename search string.

Files will only be shown if the name contains the search string (ie: a substring match).

# Group 12 : Blitter

### Function 2 : Simple Blit Copy

Copy Parameters:6,7 bytes of internal memory from Parameter:0:Parameters:1,2 to Parameter:3:Parameters:4,5. Sets error flag if the transfer is not

possible (e.g. illegal write addresses). The upper 8 bits of the address are : 6502 RAM (00) VideoRAM (80,81) Graphics RAM(90)

### Function 3 : Complex Blit Copy

Copy a source rectangular area to a destination rectangular area.

It's oriented toward copying graphics data, but can be used as a more general-purpose memory mover.

The source and target areas may be different formats, and the copy will convert the data on the fly.

For example, you can expand 4bpp source graphics (two pixels per byte) into the 1 pixel per byte framebuffer.

However, the blitting is byte-oriented. So the source width is always rounded down to the nearest full byte.

Parameter  (0) is the blit action:

0 = copy

1 = copymasked - copy, but only where src is not the transparent value.

2 = solidmasked - set target to constant solid value, but only where src is not the transparent value.

See below for transparent/solid values.

Parameters (1,2) address of the source rectangle data.

Parameters (3,4) address of the target rectangle data.

The source and target rectangle data is laid out in memory as follows:

0-2     24 bit address to copy from/to (address is address:page:0)

3       pad byte (must be zero)

4-5     Stride, in bytes. This is the value to add to the address to get from one line to the next.

Used for both source and target.

For example:

- if blitting to the screen, a stride of screen width (320) would get to the next line.

- a zero source stride would repeat a single line for the whole copy.

- A negative target stride would draw from the bottom upward.

6       data format

0: bytes. Supported for both source and target.

1: pairs of 4-bit values (nibbles). Source only.

2: 8 single-bit values. Source only.

3: high nibble. Target only.

4: low nibble. Target only.

7       A constant to use as the "transparent" value for BLTACT_MASK and BLTACT_SOLID. Source only. Not used in target.

8       A constant to use as the "solid" value for BLTACT_SOLID. Source only. Not used in target.

9       Height. The number of lines to copy.

Source only. Not used in target.

The copy is driven by the source height.

10-11   Width. The number of values to copy for each line.

Source only. Not used in target.

The copy is driven by the source width.

### Function 4 : Blit Image

Blits an image from memory onto the screen. The image will be clipped, so it's safe to blit partly (or fully) offscreen-images.

Parameter  (0) is the blit action (see function 3, Complex Blit):

Parameters (1,2) address of the source rectangle data.

Parameters (3,4) x pixel coordinate on screen (signed 16 bit)

Parameters (5,6) y pixel coordinate on screen (signed 16 bit)

Parameter  (7) destination format, determines how framebuffer will be written:

0: write to whole byte.

1: unsupported

2: unsupported

3: write to high nibble only.

4: write to low nibble only.

NOTE: clipping operates at byte resolution on the source data. So, for example, if you blit a 1-bit image (format 2) to an x-position of -2, then the whole first byte will be skipped leaving 6 empty pixels on the left. Same happens on the right - either the whole source byte is used, or it'll be skipped.




# Group 13 : Editor
